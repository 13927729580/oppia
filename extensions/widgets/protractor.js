/* Each interactive widget's protractor file must implement the following:
 * customizeInteraction: a function that receives an element containing the
 *   widget editor followed by some number of arguments used to customize the
 *   widget in question (e.g options for the MultipleChoiceInput).
 * expectInteractionDetailsToMatch: a function that receives arguments
 *   describing the way the widget is expected to look, and is run in the
 *   player to verify the widget actually looks this way.
 * submitAnswer: a function that is sent a single 'answer' argument and should
 *   then use it to answer the widget in this way, for example by selecting an
 *   option in MultipleChoiceInput.
 * answerObjectType: the name of the type of object returned by the widget.
 * testSuite: an array of dictionaries each containing:
 * - interactionArguments: an array of arguments that will be splatted and sent
 *   (together with the editor element) to the widget's customizeInteraction()
 *   function.
 * - ruleArguments: an array of arguments, the first of which should be the
 *   name of the rule to be used and the rest parameters for that rule.
 * - expectedInteractionDetails: an array of arguments that will be splatted and
 *   sent to expectInteractionDetailsToMatch when the widget is being run in
 *   the player.
 * - wrongAnswers: an array of arguments that will be submitted in sequence via
 *   the widget's submitAnswer() function; it will be verified that all these
 *   answers fail to satisfy the given rule.
 * - correctAnswers: likewise, but these should satisfy the rule.
